Final project week hasn't even begun, and I'm already close to finished with my React project. In pursuit of my new career path, I've found myself as excited as I have been in years.

As much as I enjoy coding, what has been particularly compelling is the ability to create a new road for myself and embark on a new career. To me, programmers are the new architects. The great buildings have already been designed; we are the architects of the future, now.

Knowing that, I want to find my space. I want to land in a position where I'm respected and connected. My career coach has already pointed out traits of mine that will help me when I'm searching for the right companies. I will have to treat the job search part of this equation with the same fervor as I did for the regular curriculum.

I'm already thinking about how much I'm going to miss school, my classmates and my teacher. I don't know what I would have done in 2020 had I not decided to join Flatiron and change careers. All things considered, I gave myself a purpose in a year full of uncertainty. I made a new path for myself while so much crumbled around me in the world. I'm so thankful for the foresight I apparently had in anticipating the need for change. 

It's put up or shut up time.
