I thought I had a firm grip on the content, but as we have gone along I am getting more confused on how to put it all together. The concepts make sense in isolation, but together is a different beast.

I'm missing the comradarie that schools usually provide as this is my first venture into online learning. I'm hoping my classmates and I can rally around each other as we make the turn toward more complicated programming.

All in all, I feel great about the work that I've done. I wish I had more time to do my own projects, learn more HTML and CSS and do weird/strange things in code, but I guess that's why they call this a bootcamp.
