This one was the hardest, most intimidating, and still the most rewarding project of the four I have completed thus far.

During pod meetings, study groups and while completing the labs, I felt comfortable with my knowledge of JavaScript. But, I never got into the groove, and project mode snuck up on me. At the beginning of working on my project, I was completely lost. It was as though I was starting on the project without having learned anything or completed any labs whatsoever. I froze.

But I stuck to it. My confidence grew with every small victory. I got more comfortable after every question I'd answer myself, leading to deleted messages to my cohort lead. Z once again pushed me to take things one at a time, but it took me a few days to really listen.

Project mode is where I learn the most at Flatiron. I love my project now. Without going into the weeds, I am problem-solving at a level I didn't think possible. I am so very proud of the work I've done. 

During one of my hardest days, I asked my cohort lead if she thought I'd be a good programmer. Her response is what I will leave you with, as it neatly sums up my experience during this project:

"I think you will be a good programmer, but you do need to work on focusing on 1 thing at a time. You do a great job seeing the bigger picture, BUT you need to break the creation of that big pic down into small, building steps."

Hopefully that's where I will start with my final project.
