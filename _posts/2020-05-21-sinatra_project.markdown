Working on this project was much harder than I'd anticipated. I got it done early, but mostly because I'm excited about design, implementation and getting through the assessment so I can move on.

It's a practical web app, one that is close to my heart and works for my profession currently as a writer.

It's amazing to me how far I've come already as a programmer. The projects are where Flatiron really shines as an education model. I get to spread my wings as an artist and coder, but I am always learning, always engaged, and always backed up by my intructor and classmates.

I can't wait to get to the next project. This one isn't quite perfect, but I have put so much time and effort into it. It's hard not to be proud.
